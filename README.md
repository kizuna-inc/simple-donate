# Live Socket Part

just do docker build and added this environment (or environment file)

```yaml
server: "localhost:1920"
room_name: "not_live"
```

P.L. : Sadly, This part of project is using vanilla javascript with socket.io to make this thing work so the config that setting up in environment gonna show on `config.js` file :(
